# Statistical-computing-with-python
 numerical analysis for statisticians and data scientists (including matrix inversion, splines, function optimization, and MCMC) with an emphasis on implementing these methods in Python. Computation strategies such as vectorization, code profiling are also applied to speed up the codes.
